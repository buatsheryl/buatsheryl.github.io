<p>This message below is for you from a sender that you should already have known by now = </p>
<p>Hi Sheryl. Welcome to this simple web i created to send a message to you. Bear with me, I'm not all too confident to even try to send this to you because i was afraid that you wouldnt even bother to open it.</p>
<p>You may notice that this things is very simple, perhaps not as cute as those you saw a couple of times in your fyp. But yeah, I'm still learning this new stuff. I did not even know if this thing was gonna even work. Aaaaaanywaysssss, maybe that was too much of an opening, so straight to the point</p>
<p>== Happy Valentine's Day!! ==</p>
<p>I hope you don't find this cringe, heheh. Btw, i do still hope we can go out, sometime. Looking for some cool places, some nice cafes round the area. Would be great. Anyways, that should be all. Sorry if I bothered you, and if I do, then good, my goal is achieved hahaha Have a nice day :D.<p/>
