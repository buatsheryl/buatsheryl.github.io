==Hello Sheryl==

This message below is for you from a sender that you already have known by now = 

Hi Sheryl. Welcome to this simple web i created to send a message to you. Bear with me, I'm not all too confident to even try to send this to you because i was afraid that you wouldnt even bother to open it. I also feel like I'm a nobody to you, maybe for now. In the future? We shall see.

 You may notice that this things is very simple, perhaps not as cute as you saw a couple of times in your fyp. But yeah, I'm still learning new stuff. I did not even know if this thing was gonna even work. Aaaaaanywaysssss, maybe that was too much of an opening, so straight to the point

== Happy Valentine's Day!! ==

I hope you don't find this cringe, heheh. Btw, i do still hope we can go out, sometime. Looking for some cool places, some nice cafes round the area. Would be great. Anyways, that should be all. Have a nice day :D.
